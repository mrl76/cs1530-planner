Instructions for runnning JUnit tests

Check the test plan, the folder and test file to make sure that no changes have been made
to the files since the tests have been written

MAKE SURE THAT THE FOLLOWING FILES ARE IN THE SAME FOLDER AS THE TEST YOU ARE RUNNING:
hamcrest-core-1.3.jar 
junit-4.12.jar
mockito-core-2.23.2.jar (used for mocks and stubs)

Use the following command to compile test files:
javac -classpath .\junit-4.12.jar;.\hamcrest-core-1.3.jar;./mockito-core-1.10.19.jar <TestFile.java> <FileToTest.java>
-replace <text> with the specified files

Run the tests using the following command after compilation:
java -cp .;.\junit-4.12.jar;.\hamcrest-core-1.3.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore <TestFile>
-<TestFile> will be the same as the <TestFile.java> except without the .java
