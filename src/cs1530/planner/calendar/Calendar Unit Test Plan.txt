Calendar Test Plan for Unit Tests
Michael Long
Created: 11/13/2018
Last Updated: 11/13/2018

Classes to test:
-Event.java
-Exam.java
-Assignment.java
-Appointment.java
-Interval.java
-Timetable.java
-Calendar.java
-Course.java

Note: Interval.java was excluded from unit testing due to it only holding an enum object (11/1/2018)

Event.java (ll/13/2018)

Methods:
public Event(String name, String description, Date date)
public Event(String name)
public String getName()
public void setName(String name)
public String getDescription()
public void setDescription(String description)
public Date getDate()
public void setDate(Date date)
public int compareTo(Event o)

Because this an abstract class I may need to extend it for a
test class
